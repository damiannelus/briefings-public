# Strategic Briefing – Executive Snapshot

The year 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal one for leadership, with a focus on adaptability, AI integration, and fostering strong team connections.  Leaders are increasingly turning to data-driven decision making and embracing technology to streamline processes and improve performance.  However, the job market remains competitive, requiring individuals to continuously upskill and network effectively. 

* **Future-proofing your business** is a top priority for leaders in 2025 (article: "Leadership Insights That Defined 2025 on the Express Blog"). This involves building high-performing teams with a proactive mindset and prioritizing targeted professional development to stay ahead of the curve (article: "2025 Year in Review: Most-Read, Most-Watched, and Most-Loved Content").
* **AI is transforming the landscape**, both for leaders and job seekers.  While AI is automating tasks, it also creates new opportunities for individuals who can leverage it effectively (articles: "How Webflow’s CPO built an AI chief of staff to manage her calendar, prep for meetings, and drive AI adoption | Rachel Wolan", "Presentation: Fix SLO Breaches before They Repeat: an SRE AI Agent for Application Workloads").
* **Remote work is here to stay**, requiring intentional efforts to maintain team connection and culture (article: "This is what kept our remote team connected in 2025").  Building strong relationships through shared experiences, traditions, and gratitude is crucial for success.

AI is rapidly changing the landscape for both leaders and job seekers.  Leaders are using AI to automate tasks, improve decision making, and drive innovation (article: "How Webflow’s CPO built an AI chief of staff to manage her calendar, prep for meetings, and drive AI adoption | Rachel Wolan"). Job seekers who can leverage AI effectively will have a competitive advantage in the market (article: "Revisiting the Express Blog’s Most Valuable Job Seeker Insights").

* **For Senior managers, heads of delivery, consulting leaders:** This means understanding how to integrate AI into your workflows and processes.  
* **Actionable Steps:** 
    1. **Identify key tasks that can be automated with AI tools.** Analyze your current workflow and pinpoint areas where AI could improve efficiency or accuracy.
    2. **Develop a strategy for upskilling your team in AI literacy.** Invest in training programs or workshops to equip your team members with the skills needed to understand and utilize AI effectively.

They also need to be adaptable and willing to experiment with new ideas (articles: "2025 Year in Review: Most-Read, Most-Watched, and Most-Loved Content", "Junior designers have a perception problem-here’s how to fix it").
* **Technology in Practice:** AI is becoming increasingly important in various fields, from software development to design.
