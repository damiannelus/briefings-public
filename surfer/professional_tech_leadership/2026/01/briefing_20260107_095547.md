# Strategic Briefing – Executive Snapshot

Tech leaders face a rapidly evolving AI landscape where adoption requires hands-on fluency and structured decision frameworks, as demonstrated by Zapier’s CEO who leverages AI to improve hiring processes and Swiggy’s Hermes V3, which boosted SQL query accuracy from 54% to 93%. In parallel, cybersecurity and infrastructure risks remain acute, with at least 10 undersea cables damaged since 2023 in the Baltic Sea, raising concerns about sabotage and economic stability. Meanwhile, innovation in hardware sensing is advancing, exemplified by Teradar’s Summit terahertz sensor unveiled at CES 2026, offering high-resolution, all-weather imaging without moving parts, potentially revolutionizing automotive safety.

## Cross-Category Synthesis

- The integration of AI into delivery and consulting workflows is most effective when leaders actively engage in AI fluency and create frameworks for responsible use, as seen in the A3 Framework for AI delegation and Wade Foster’s AI adoption at Zapier. Both emphasize the necessity of human judgment, accountability, and transparency to avoid over-reliance on automation, highlighting a shared understanding across leadership and delivery process optimization domains.

- Security concerns in critical infrastructure, such as the undersea cable damages in the Baltic Sea and the uncertain future of the US Cyber Trust Mark Program for smart home security, underscore a growing tension between technological advancement and regulatory/governance challenges. These issues impact delivery teams working in regulated industries, requiring heightened risk management and stakeholder alignment to mitigate operational disruptions.

## Macro Spotlight – Deep Dive

The strategic imperative today lies in balancing rapid AI adoption with responsible governance and security in tech-driven organizations. The case of Zapier’s CEO Wade Foster illustrates that AI fluency cannot be delegated; leaders must personally engage with AI tools to create safe experimentation environments and leverage AI for talent acquisition, culture analysis, and decision-making. This hands-on approach aligns with the A3 Framework’s categorization of AI tasks into Assist, Automate, or Avoid, ensuring that AI amplifies rather than replaces human expertise. For senior managers and heads of delivery, this means prioritizing AI literacy as a core leadership competency and embedding explicit AI fluency expectations within teams by the end of 2026.

Swiggy’s release of Hermes V3, which improved SQL generation accuracy from 54% to 93%, exemplifies how conversational AI can transform data accessibility for non-technical stakeholders, accelerating data-informed decision-making. Delivery and product leaders should consider integrating similar AI-driven tools to reduce time-to-insight and empower broader organizational engagement with data. However, this requires careful change management to avoid analysis paralysis and ensure transparency in AI-driven outputs.

Concurrently, the persistent sabotage of undersea telecommunication cables—at least 10 incidents since 2023 in the Baltic Sea—signals escalating risks to critical infrastructure. For consulting leaders and delivery managers in regulated industries like energy and fintech, this necessitates revisiting risk management frameworks and strengthening stakeholder communication around infrastructure resilience. The uncertain future of the US Cyber Trust Mark Program further complicates cybersecurity governance, potentially leaving smart home and IoT device security standards in flux. Organizations must proactively assess their exposure and advocate for robust security certifications to safeguard delivery pipelines and customer trust.

On the hardware innovation front, Teradar’s Summit terahertz sensor, unveiled at CES 2026, offers a breakthrough with its ability to provide high-resolution imaging in any weather without moving parts, a significant advance for automotive safety and sensor reliability. Product and engineering leaders should monitor such emerging technologies for potential integration into platform modernization efforts, especially in regulated sectors where safety and compliance are paramount.

For senior managers and individual contributors aiming for leadership roles, these trends collectively imply a need to develop cross-disciplinary expertise: mastering AI tools and frameworks, deepening security risk awareness, and staying abreast of hardware innovations that may disrupt existing delivery models. Career development plans should include targeted AI fluency certifications, risk management training, and active participation in cross-functional innovation initiatives within the next 12 months to 3 years.

## Category Deep Dives

### Technology in Practice

The dominant trend is the accelerated, yet nuanced, adoption of AI across leadership, delivery, and product functions. Key data points include Swiggy’s Hermes V3 improving SQL accuracy from 54% to 93% and Zapier’s CEO demonstrating practical AI workflows for hiring and culture analysis. Additionally, the A3 Framework promotes responsible AI delegation by categorizing tasks into Assist, Automate, or Avoid, emphasizing judgment and accountability.

For senior managers and heads of delivery, this means embedding AI fluency as a leadership expectation and establishing clear governance frameworks for AI use within teams. Monitoring AI adoption metrics such as task categorization compliance and AI-driven process accuracy on a quarterly basis will be critical. Furthermore, emerging hardware innovations like Teradar’s Summit sensor highlight the need to integrate new technologies into product roadmaps, especially in safety-critical domains.

#### Strategic Action Plan

- If your organization’s AI-driven decision accuracy (e.g., SQL query generation) is below 70%, implement structured AI fluency training and adopt frameworks like A3 within the next 12 months to improve reliability and accountability.

- Given the ongoing sabotage of undersea cables (10 incidents since 2023), delivery leaders in regulated industries should conduct a comprehensive risk assessment and update infrastructure protection plans by Q3 2026.

- Monitor AI adoption progress by establishing quarterly reviews of AI task delegation categories (Assist, Automate, Avoid) and ensure at least 80% compliance with accountability guidelines within 12 months, adjusting team roles and training accordingly.
