# Strategic Briefing – Executive Snapshot

Tech leaders face a shifting landscape where AI adoption demands hands-on leadership and structured decision-making, as demonstrated by Zapier’s CEO who uses AI to evaluate candidates and extract company culture, emphasizing that AI fluency cannot be delegated. Swiggy’s Hermes V3 conversational AI improved SQL query accuracy from 54% to 93%, showcasing how AI can drastically enhance data accessibility for business users. Meanwhile, PyPI reported managing 9,059 projects across 7,742 organizations in 2025, underlining the critical importance of security enhancements like two-factor authentication and trusted publishing in software supply chain integrity.

## Cross-Category Synthesis

1. Both the adoption of AI in delivery and consulting leadership (Zapier’s CEO’s AI stack) and the development of conversational AI tools (Swiggy’s Hermes V3) highlight a clear trend: AI is moving from experimental to operational, requiring leaders to embed AI fluency into their teams and workflows to improve decision-making and productivity. This is supported by the emphasis on judgment, trust-building, and accountability in AI-assisted Agile practices.

2. The focus on security and reliability in software ecosystems (PyPI’s 7,742 organizations and 9,059 projects with enhanced security measures) aligns with the need for rigorous governance in AI adoption, as seen in frameworks like the A3 Framework for responsible AI use. Both stress that technological advances must be balanced with transparency and human oversight to mitigate risks.

## Macro Spotlight – Deep Dive: AI Adoption and Leadership in Tech-Driven Organizations

The integration of AI into tech and consulting environments is accelerating, but its success hinges on leadership that combines hands-on fluency with structured governance. Wade Foster, CEO of Zapier, exemplifies this by personally using AI tools to extract company culture from meeting data, build interview evaluation agents, and identify hidden talent. This approach moves beyond issuing AI memos to embedding AI into daily workflows, creating “safe play spaces” for experimentation. For senior managers and delivery leaders, this means prioritizing AI literacy within their teams and actively shaping AI adoption strategies rather than delegating them.

Swiggy’s release of Hermes V3, a GenAI-powered text-to-SQL assistant, demonstrates the tangible impact of AI on business processes. The system improved SQL generation accuracy from 54% to 93%, enabling natural, multi-turn interactions that empower non-technical employees to query data in plain English. This shift reduces dependency on specialized data teams and accelerates decision-making cycles. Delivery managers should consider how similar AI tools can optimize workflows and reduce bottlenecks in data access, while product leaders must evaluate user experience implications and integration complexity.

On the security front, PyPI’s 2025 report shows the critical role of proactive measures in safeguarding software supply chains. With over 7,742 organizations and 9,059 projects under management, PyPI’s enhancements—such as two-factor authentication, trusted publishing, and attestations—have prevented numerous potential attacks. For consulting leads and engineering managers, this underscores the importance of embedding security practices early in the delivery lifecycle, especially in regulated industries where compliance and risk management are paramount.

Three scenarios emerge: If AI adoption accelerates with strong leadership and governance, organizations will see productivity gains and improved decision-making accuracy, as illustrated by Zapier and Swiggy. If adoption stalls due to lack of leadership engagement or poor governance, AI investments risk becoming costly experiments with limited impact. Conversely, if security measures lag behind AI integration, organizations may face increased vulnerabilities, threatening business continuity and trust.

For senior managers and heads of delivery, this means actively investing in AI fluency programs, establishing clear AI governance frameworks like the A3 Framework, and prioritizing security enhancements in software supply chains. Ambitious individual contributors preparing for leadership roles should focus on developing skills in AI-assisted decision-making, stakeholder communication around AI risks, and integrating security best practices into delivery processes.

### Technology in Practice

AI adoption is advancing rapidly with practical implementations improving operational efficiency and decision-making accuracy, exemplified by Swiggy’s Hermes V3 boosting SQL query accuracy from 54% to 93%. Simultaneously, PyPI’s management of 9,059 projects across 7,742 organizations in 2025 highlights the growing scale and criticality of secure software supply chains. Leaders must balance rapid AI integration with robust governance and security practices to mitigate risks.

For senior managers and delivery heads, this means allocating budget and resources to AI fluency training and security enhancements, monitoring AI adoption metrics such as accuracy improvements and user engagement monthly, and ensuring compliance with emerging cybersecurity standards. Individual contributors aiming for leadership roles should prioritize gaining hands-on AI experience and understanding security implications in complex delivery environments.

#### Strategic Action Plan

- If your team’s AI-driven decision accuracy (e.g., SQL query correctness) is below 70%, implement targeted AI literacy and workflow integration programs within the next 6 months, inspired by Swiggy’s Hermes V3 improvement from 54% to 93%.

- Given PyPI’s example of managing 9,059 projects with enhanced security, set a quarterly review cadence to assess and improve your project’s security posture, including two-factor authentication and supply chain transparency measures, aiming for measurable reductions in vulnerabilities within 12 months.

- If AI adoption initiatives lack executive sponsorship or hands-on leadership (as stressed by Zapier’s CEO), establish a leadership-driven AI governance framework within 3 months that includes explicit fluency expectations and safe experimentation spaces, to avoid stalled or ineffective AI integration.
