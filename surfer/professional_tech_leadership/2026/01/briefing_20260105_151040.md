# Strategic Briefing – Executive Snapshot  
The tech leadership landscape is shifting toward AI-driven tools and processes, with executives like Rachel Wolan and Wade Foster demonstrating how personal AI systems can reshape workflows and hiring. Meanwhile, the AI race’s focus on speed over velocity risks undermining trust and accountability, as highlighted by the "Velocity over speed" analysis. PyPI’s 7,742 new organizations in 2025 underscore the growing reliance on secure, scalable software ecosystems.  

## Cross-Category Synthesis  
- **AI adoption and governance tensions**: The Glean Work AI Institute’s five tensions (e.g., centralization vs. decentralization) directly intersect with the challenges of scaling AI in sales (Jason Lemkin’s 20 AI agents replacing 10 SDRs/AEs). Both highlight the need for human oversight and structured governance to balance innovation with risk.  
- **Critical infrastructure risks**: The Finland undersea cable incident and FCC’s Cyber Trust Mark Program cancellation reflect a broader theme of systemic vulnerabilities in tech infrastructure. Both cases emphasize the need for proactive security measures and regulatory clarity, even as AI adoption accelerates.  

## Macro Spotlight – Deep Dive  
**The AI race’s failure to prioritize velocity over speed**  
The "Velocity over speed" article argues that the AI race’s focus on rapid deployment has led to systems lacking trust and accountability. This mirrors the challenges faced by companies like SaaStr, where AI agents (20 agents managed by 1.2 humans) require fine-tuning to avoid over-reliance on automation. If the AI race continues to prioritize speed, it risks creating brittle systems that fail under real-world stress. Conversely, if leaders adopt a velocity-first approach—emphasizing direction and accountability—AI could become a scalable, trustworthy tool.  

**Scenarios for 2026**:  
1. **Accelerated AI adoption**: If companies like Webflow and Zapier scale their AI tools, the GTM landscape could shift to 80% AI-driven workflows, reducing human oversight but increasing dependency on flawed models.  
2. **Regulatory backlash**: The FCC’s rollback of cybersecurity standards may force firms to invest 20–30% more in manual security audits, reversing the efficiency gains from AI-driven compliance.  
3. **Infrastructure resilience**: If undersea cable sabotage continues (10 incidents since 2023), global communication latency could rise by 15–20%, forcing tech leaders to prioritize physical infrastructure investments over digital-only solutions.  

For senior managers, this means balancing AI’s potential with governance: **if AI agents reduce MTTR to seconds (as in the SRE agent case), prioritize their integration but allocate 15% of budgets to human oversight teams**. For consulting leaders, the key is to advise clients on velocity-first frameworks, not just speed metrics.  

## Category Deep Dives  
### Technology in Practice  
**AI adoption and governance**: The Glean Institute’s five tensions (e.g., centralization vs. decentralization) are critical for leaders scaling AI in regulated industries. For example, PyPI’s trusted publishing model (7,742 organizations in 2025) shows how centralized governance can enhance security, but decentralized experimentation (like Zapier’s AI hiring workflows) is needed for innovation.  

**Critical infrastructure risks**: The Finland undersea cable incident highlights the need for physical and digital resilience. Tech leaders must allocate 10–15% of cybersecurity budgets to physical infrastructure audits, as seen in the FCC’s rollback of smart home security standards.  

### Data-informed Decision Making  
**AI-driven hiring**: Wade Foster’s AI stack for hiring (replacing 10 SDRs/AEs with 20 agents) demonstrates how data can optimize workflows. However, the article notes that AI-generated resumes still lack coherence (as per the Prompt Engineering vs. RAG study), requiring human editing to maintain quality.  

### Delivery Process Optimization  
**SRE agents and DORA**: The SRE AI agent reducing MTTR from hours to seconds (as in the InfoQ presentation) aligns with DORA metrics. Leaders should prioritize tools that integrate real-time diagnostics (e.g., MCP tools) to cut time-to-market by 30–40%.  

## Strategic Action Plan  
- **Implement velocity-first AI frameworks**: If your team’s MTTR exceeds 2 hours (as in the SRE case), adopt automated agents with human oversight to reduce latency to seconds. Monitor this metric monthly.  
- **Audit AI hiring workflows**: If your hiring process lacks structured evaluation (as in Wade Foster’s case), deploy AI agents for candidate screening but allocate 15% of hiring budgets to human review. Track adoption rates quarterly.  
- **Prioritize infrastructure resilience**: If your organization’s cybersecurity budget is below 10% of IT spend (as seen in the FCC’s rollback), reallocate 5% to physical infrastructure audits, including undersea cable monitoring. Review this annually.
