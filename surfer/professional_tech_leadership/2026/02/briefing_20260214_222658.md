# Strategic Briefing – Executive Snapshot

Telcos in North America implemented port 23 filtering in mid-January, causing a 59% drop in Telnet traffic from an average of 914,000 daily sessions to about 373,000, likely in response to a critical CVE-2026-24061 vulnerability with a 9.8 CVSS score. Anthropic’s Claude AI gained an 11% increase in daily active users following a Super Bowl ad campaign, propelling it into the top 10 free apps on the Apple App Store, surpassing competitors like OpenAI and Google Gemini. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy underscored the necessity for ironclad security guarantees and increased allied support amid ongoing Russian aggression, signaling a sustained geopolitical risk that tech and consulting leaders must factor into strategic planning.

## Macro Spotlight – Deep Dive

The sudden and sustained 59% reduction in Telnet traffic starting January 14, 2026, reveals a proactive security posture by Tier 1 North American transit providers, who likely received early warnings about the decade-old GNU InetUtils telnetd vulnerability (CVE-2026-24061) before public disclosure on January 20. This vulnerability, rated 9.8 on the CVSS scale, allows trivial root access exploitation, posing a critical risk to legacy systems still relying on Telnet. The filtering of port 23 traffic demonstrates an effective, if blunt, mitigation tactic that reduces attack surface but may disrupt legacy integrations, forcing delivery and engineering leaders to accelerate legacy migrations and platform modernization efforts in regulated industries like fintech and energy.

If this trend of early vulnerability intelligence sharing and rapid infrastructure response accelerates, organizations can expect a shorter window of exposure to critical exploits, incentivizing investment in real-time threat intelligence and automated patching workflows. Conversely, if such preemptive actions stall or become inconsistent, the risk of widespread exploitation rises, increasing the burden on delivery teams to manage incident response and risk mitigation under pressure. For senior managers and heads of delivery, this means prioritizing investments in dependency and risk management processes that incorporate threat intelligence feeds and automated controls to reduce time-to-market for security patches.

Parallel to security developments, Anthropic’s Claude AI’s 11% user growth post-Super Bowl ad highlights the growing importance of strategic marketing in AI product adoption. Claude’s rise into the top 10 free apps on Apple’s App Store, overtaking established players like ChatGPT and Google Gemini, underscores that brand positioning and user engagement campaigns materially impact market share. For product and consulting leaders, this signals a need to balance technical innovation with deliberate brand-building and user experience strategies to differentiate in a crowded AI landscape. The trade-off lies in allocating budget and talent between core AI development and marketing efforts, with measurable user growth as a key performance indicator.

On the geopolitical front, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy’s call for ironclad security guarantees and increased allied support amid ongoing Russian aggression stresses the persistent instability in Eastern Europe. While lacking explicit numeric data, this strategic context affects global supply chains, energy markets, and regulatory environments, especially in tech sectors operating in or dependent on these regions. For delivery managers and consulting leads, this implies heightened risk management for projects involving regulated industries and cross-border integrations, necessitating contingency planning and stakeholder alignment workshops to navigate shifting priorities and geopolitical uncertainties.

In summary, these converging trends emphasize the criticality of integrating security intelligence into delivery workflows, leveraging marketing as a strategic lever in AI product growth, and embedding geopolitical risk awareness into project and portfolio management. Leaders must make informed trade-offs between speed, security, and market positioning while preparing teams for complexity and volatility in the next 12 to 36 months (źródło: ["Sudden Telnet Traffic Drop"](https://tech.slashdot.org/story/26/02/14/0447228/sudden-telnet-traffic-drop-are-telcos-filtering-ports-to-block-critical-vulnerability?), ["Anthropic's Claude Got 11% User Boost"](https://slashdot.org/story/26/02/14/0235231/anthropics-claude-got-11-user-boost-from-super-bowl-ad-mocking-chatgpts-advertising?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed), ["Zelenskyy says Putin only interested in continued war"](https://www.politico.eu/article/volodymyr-zelenskyy-vladimir-putin-slave-to-war-russia-ukraine/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication)).

## Category Deep Dives

### Leadership and Organization  
The focus on building personal brand value over mere AI adoption reflects a leadership imperative to differentiate through expertise and judgment rather than chasing technology trends blindly. For senior leaders and aspiring product or delivery managers, this means investing in communication, stakeholder alignment, and facilitation skills to make value “irresistible” in competitive markets. Career development should emphasize strategic positioning alongside technical proficiency.

### Technology in Practice  
The 59% drop in Telnet traffic following pre-disclosure vulnerability warnings illustrates the impact of coordinated infrastructure defense, underscoring the need for delivery teams to integrate threat intelligence into risk management. AI product marketing also proves critical, with Claude’s 11% user boost post-Super Bowl ad showing that technical excellence alone is insufficient for market success. Additionally, emerging AI applications in fashion tech and IoT privacy risks highlight the growing complexity of integrating AI responsibly across domains. Leaders must balance innovation with security, compliance, and user experience.

### Macrotrends and Business Context  
Global geopolitical tensions remain acute, with Zelenskyy’s emphasis on security guarantees and Navalny’s poisoning underscoring authoritarian risks that affect global stability. These factors complicate delivery in regulated industries and cross-border projects, requiring robust scenario planning. Meanwhile, accelerating global warming trends demand attention to sustainability in tech operations, though explicit numeric targets are absent. Leaders should monitor these macro risks closely to inform strategic decisions.

### Other  
Creative innovation continues to thrive in unexpected areas, from AI-generated art to unique musical instrument competitions, reflecting the value of cross-disciplinary inspiration. Platforms aggregating diverse blogs (2,380 blogs on Ooh.directory) emphasize the importance of diverse perspectives, which can enrich consulting and product ideation. While less directly tied to delivery metrics, these trends support a culture of creativity and continuous learning essential for leadership growth.
