# Strategic Briefing – Executive Snapshot
The European People’s Party (EPP) is intensifying internal coordination to tighten central control over policy, responding to surging opposition across the political spectrum, a move that could reshape EU governance dynamics. A global survey of 828 enterprise IT professionals reveals that 39% expect increased spending on software security testing and 36% on API security within the next 12–18 months, signaling a clear shift toward embedding security in development workflows. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s integration of Sysmon directly into Windows addresses a longstanding operational challenge for enterprise administrators managing thousands of endpoints, potentially improving system monitoring efficiency at scale.

## Macro Spotlight – Deep Dive
The push by the European People’s Party (EPP) to centralize policy decision-making reflects a strategic response to political fragmentation and opposition growth within the EU. After a challenging first year under Ursula von der Leyen’s second term, the EPP convened twice in one week to strengthen internal coordination, led by influential figures like German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. This centralization effort aims to deliver tangible policy changes but risks alienating other parties and complicating coalition-building. For senior leaders in tech-driven organizations operating in or with the EU, this signals potential shifts in regulatory environments and policy stability that require close monitoring and agile adaptation strategies (source: [Politico](https://www.politico.eu/article/ursula-von-der-leyen-friedrich-merz-europe-conservatives-gather-leadership-pushes-tighten-central-control/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication)).

Concurrently, the IT industry is responding to escalating cybersecurity threats by prioritizing software security testing and API security. A survey of 828 enterprise IT professionals found that 39% expect increased investment in software security testing and 36% in API security over the next 12 to 18 months. This trend is driven by the growing complexity of AI-powered workflows and cloud-native architectures, which introduce new vulnerabilities if not proactively managed. For heads of delivery and engineering leaders, this means allocating budget and resources toward security tooling and embedding security practices early in the development lifecycle to mitigate risk and avoid costly breaches (source: [DevOps.com](https://devops.com/survey-surfaces-more-focus-software-security-testing-and-api-security/)).

On the operational front, Microsoft’s integration of Sysmon into Windows addresses a critical pain point for enterprise administrators who previously struggled with deploying and managing this system monitoring tool across thousands of endpoints. While not a revolutionary change, this move enhances official support and simplifies monitoring workflows, reducing operational overhead and risk of misconfiguration. Delivery managers and engineering leads should evaluate the impact of this integration on their monitoring strategies and endpoint security posture, especially in large-scale environments where Sysmon adoption was previously hindered by deployment complexity (source: [Slashdot](https://tech.slashdot.org/story/26/02/05/0023249/microsoft-adds-sysmon-to-windows?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed)).

Three scenarios emerge from these converging trends: if the EPP’s centralization accelerates, expect tighter regulatory frameworks affecting tech compliance and cross-border projects; if cybersecurity investments lag despite awareness, organizations risk increased exposure to sophisticated attacks; and if Microsoft’s Sysmon integration proves effective, it may set a precedent for deeper OS-level tooling integration, influencing enterprise monitoring standards. For senior managers and consulting leaders, these developments underscore the need for strategic agility in regulatory compliance, security investment prioritization, and operational tooling modernization.

## Category Deep Dives

### Macrotrends and Business Context
The EPP’s effort to tighten central control over EU policy reflects a strategic pivot amid rising opposition, signaling potential shifts in the political landscape that could affect regulatory certainty. Senior leaders should monitor this trend closely, as it may impact cross-border projects, compliance requirements, and funding priorities within the EU.

### Job Market and Career Development
Companies increasingly recognize the value of retaining older employees for their experience and institutional knowledge, a vital consideration given demographic shifts. Career leaders should advocate for age-inclusive policies and leverage this talent pool to maintain continuity and deepen organizational expertise.

### Leadership and Organization
Leadership crises, such as the scrutiny faced by UK’s Keir Starmer over appointment controversies, highlight the critical importance of due diligence and accountability in leadership roles. For consulting and delivery leaders, this underscores the need for transparent decision-making and risk management in personnel and stakeholder alignment.

### Technology in Practice
Security remains a top priority, with 39% of surveyed IT professionals expecting increased spending on software security testing and 36% on API security within 12–18 months. Microsoft’s integration of Sysmon into Windows will ease system monitoring for enterprises managing thousands of endpoints, potentially reducing operational risk. Additionally, AI-powered workflow automation tools are democratizing development, enabling non-technical team members to contribute to production-ready features, which delivery managers should consider when scaling teams and optimizing workflows.
