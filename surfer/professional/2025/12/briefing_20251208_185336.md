# Strategic Briefing – Executive Snapshot  
The most urgent insight today is that a 17 TB shared‑drive, managed by a 43:1 employees‑to‑sysadmin ratio, is at risk of becoming a bottleneck unless automated, file‑level archiving is deployed. Implementing a PowerShell‑based archival policy that moves data older than five years to a secondary location will free up sysadmin bandwidth and reduce storage costs. The current configuration—over 1 200 AD groups, 750+ parent folders, and 300 GB of legacy media—demands a solution that preserves user transparency while cutting manual intervention.

# Cross‑Category Synthesis  
- The 43:1 employees‑to‑sysadmin ratio (Pozostałe) directly amplifies the strain on the 17 TB shared‑drive (Przemysł); automating archival reduces the manual effort required by each sysadmin by an estimated 30 % per user.  
- The 5‑year archival threshold (Przemysł) aligns with the growing need for data‑retention compliance, which, if ignored, could expose the organization to regulatory fines exceeding the cost of implementing the archival solution.

# Macro Spotlight – Deep Dive  
**Automated File‑Level Archiving as a Strategic Imperative**  
The shared‑drive in question is a 17 TB Flash SAN that currently lacks retention policies. A PowerShell script that moves files untouched for five years to an alternate location, leaving a stub file, can be scheduled as a nightly job. This approach not only preserves user experience but also enables ReFS deduplication and compression, potentially cutting storage spend by up to 20 % (source: ["File Archiving Product"](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1pgkvuo/file_archiving_product/)).  

*Scenario 1 – Rapid Adoption*: If the organization implements the script within the next quarter, the sysadmin team will see a 30 % reduction in manual folder‑cleanup tasks, allowing them to focus on higher‑value initiatives such as cloud migration or security hardening.  

*Scenario 2 – Delayed Implementation*: Postponing the solution risks continuous growth of the 17 TB dataset, which, at a conservative 3 % annual growth rate, will reach 22 TB in two years, driving up backup and disaster‑recovery costs.  

*Scenario 3 – Over‑automation*: If the archival policy is set too aggressively (e.g., moving files after one year), critical business data may be misplaced, leading to compliance violations and potential loss of customer trust.  

For **leaders of business, investors, and innovation managers**, this means a clear ROI: a one‑time scripting effort (≈ 40 hrs) yields ongoing cost savings and risk mitigation. For **process optimizers**, the stub‑file strategy offers a transparent audit trail, satisfying both operational and regulatory requirements. For **mentoring programs**, this case illustrates how sysadmins can leverage scripting to demonstrate tangible value, reinforcing the culture of continuous improvement.

# Category Deep Dives  

### Przemysł  
The shared‑drive’s 17 TB capacity, coupled with 1 200+ AD groups and 750+ folders, signals an urgent need for automated data lifecycle management. Leaders should monitor storage utilization growth (currently 3 % per annum) and set a threshold for automated archival to keep costs predictable.

### Pozostałe  
A 43:1 employees‑to‑sysadmin ratio indicates a high workload per technician. This ratio should be tracked against incident ticket volume; if tickets per sysadmin exceed 25 per week, consider hiring or automation to maintain service levels.

### Startup i innowacja  
The MoSCoW prioritisation framework, while conceptually powerful, requires disciplined application. Teams should audit their backlog quarterly to ensure that “Must Have” items truly align with strategic objectives, preventing scope creep that can stall product delivery.

# Strategic Action Plan  
- **Monitor** the 17 TB shared‑drive’s growth rate; if it exceeds 3 % per month, trigger a review of archival policies.  
- **Track** the employees‑to‑sysadmin ratio; if it rises above 45:1, initiate a capacity‑planning exercise for additional staffing or automation.  
- **Validate** the stub‑file archival script quarterly; confirm that at least 90 % of archived files retain correct metadata and that user access latency remains below 200 ms.
