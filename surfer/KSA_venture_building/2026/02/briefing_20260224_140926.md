# Strategic Briefing – Executive Snapshot

## Macro Spotlight – Deep Dive  
### Strategic Thread: Venture Building and AI Deployment as Drivers of Innovation  
The Middle East is emerging as a key hub for venture building and AI innovation, with institutional investors and academic institutions driving strategic initiatives. Riyadh Valley Company's collaboration with King Saud University exemplifies this trend, leveraging SparkLabs to support early-stage startups. Similarly, the Qatar Investment Authority's partnership with 5C Investment Partners underscores the region's commitment to scaling lending platforms and financial technology ventures. These efforts align with broader economic goals, positioning the UAE and Gulf countries as leaders in venture building and AI deployment.  

The Presight-Shorooq AI Fund's $100M investment in five frontier AI companies demonstrates confidence in AI-native products with strong data advantages. This initiative bridges East and West, accelerating AI's commercialization in sectors like finance and construction. Meanwhile, Deloitte's report highlights GenAI's mainstream adoption in the GCC, with a significant drop in non-adoption rates. However, scaling remains a challenge, requiring structured roadmaps and governance frameworks.
