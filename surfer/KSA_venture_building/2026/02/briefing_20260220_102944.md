## Macro Spotlight – Deep Dive  
### Geopolitical and Macroeconomic Uncertainty Driving Commodity Volatility  

The surge in oil prices to $71.66 for Brent crude, driven by US-Iran tensions, highlights how geopolitical instability directly impacts commodity markets. This rise is amplified by concerns over potential supply disruptions, which may prompt OPEC+ to reconsider output increases. Conversely, copper prices are set to decline for the third consecutive week, influenced by weak demand from China and a stronger US dollar, which makes the metal more expensive for non-US buyers. These diverging trends underscore the challenges of navigating global markets under dual pressures of geopolitical risks and macroeconomic headwinds.  

For Tech leaders and venture builders, the volatility in commodities like copper reflects broader economic uncertainty, which could affect supply chains and manufacturing costs. Companies with exposure to these inputs must prioritize financial prudence and explore hedging strategies to mitigate risks. Meanwhile, the oil surge introduces opportunities for ventures in energy tech or sustainable alternatives, but success will depend on geopolitical stability and demand resilience.
