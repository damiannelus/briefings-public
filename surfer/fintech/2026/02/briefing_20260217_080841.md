# Strategic Briefing – Executive Snapshot  
The crypto market continues to evolve amid institutional adoption, regulatory scrutiny, and technological innovation. Tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) demonstrated resilience, growing 13.5% despite broader market volatility. Meanwhile, regulatory developments, such as Hong Kong's approval of Victory Fintech, signal a gradual normalization of the crypto industry under strict oversight.  

## Macro Spotlight – Deep Dive  
### Crypto & DeFi  
The crypto market is navigating a complex interplay of institutional adoption, regulatory tightening, and technological advancements. Tokenized RWAs surged 13.5% in value, attracting institutional interest despite broader market turmoil. This growth underscores the increasing integration of traditional finance with decentralized systems, with tokenized US Treasurys leading the surge.  

Regulatory developments are shaping the sector’s trajectory. Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission approved Victory Fintech, the first license since June 2025, highlighting a move toward formalizing crypto services. Conversely, the EU is considering a ban on Russian crypto transactions, reflecting geopolitical tensions and the ongoing tension between financial sanctions and decentralized systems.  

Institutional adoption continues to gain momentum, with companies like Nexo returning to the U.S. market after regulatory battles. Nexo’s strategy of offering regulated services, including crypto credit lines and exchanges, exemplifies the maturing crypto industry.  

However, the market remains vulnerable to volatility and regulatory uncertainty. Bitcoin’s price action mirrored the 2022 bear market through weekly RSI readings, suggesting a potential bottoming phase, but elevated leverage and liquidation clusters near $1,909 and $2,200 pose significant risks.  

### Banking Innovation  
Banks are accelerating partnerships with fintech firms to enhance customer experiences and streamline operations. The collaboration between Backbase and Plaid aims to expedite customer onboarding, leveraging AI and data networks to create seamless digital experiences. This partnership is part of a broader trend where traditional institutions integrate fintech innovations to meet evolving customer expectations.  

eToro’s partnership with Stockperks to strengthen shareholder engagement reflects a strategic focus on deepening relationships with retail investors. As eToro’s user base grows to 40 million registered users, such initiatives underscore the platform’s commitment to democratizing finance.
